Introduction:
Google Gemini is a powerful cloud-based image generation API that allows developers to create dynamic images using a simple URL endpoint. In this blog post, we will walk you through how to build an image generator using Google Gemini and Firecrawl.

Problem Statement:
Generating dynamic images on the fly can be a challenging task for developers. Traditional image generation methods can be time-consuming and require a lot of resources. Google Gemini offers a solution by providing a simple API that can be used to generate images based on dynamic data.

How Firecrawl helps:
Firecrawl is a web scraping tool that can be used to collect data from the web and feed it into Google Gemini to generate images. By using Firecrawl to collect data, developers can easily create dynamic images based on real-time information.

Code Examples:
Let's start by setting up a simple image generator using Google Gemini and Firecrawl. First, we need to collect some data using Firecrawl. Here's a sample code snippet to scrape data from a website:

```python
from firecrawl import Firecrawl

# Initialize Firecrawl
fc = Firecrawl()

# Set the URL to scrape
url = 'https://example.com'

# Scrape the website
data = fc.scrape(url)

print(data)
```

Once we have collected the data using Firecrawl, we can use Google Gemini to generate an image based on that data. Here's an example of how to generate an image using Google Gemini:

```python
from google_gemini import Gemini

# Initialize Google Gemini
gemini = Gemini()

# Set the data and template for the image
data = {
    'title': 'Example Title',
    'content': 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet'
}

template = 'example-template.png'

# Generate the image
img_url = gemini.generate_image(data, template)

print(img_url)
```

Conclusion:
In this blog post, we have shown you how to build an image generator using Google Gemini and Firecrawl. By leveraging these tools, developers can easily create dynamic images based on real-time data from the web. With a simple API and powerful web scraping capabilities, building an image generator has never been easier.
