🔥 Firecrawl Agent
Firecrawl Agent is an autonomous content creation pipeline built for developers and startups using Firecrawl, LLMs, and Notion. It ideates trending topics, generates SEO-rich blog content, validates tone, publishes to Notion, and tracks performance — all automatically.

🚀 What It Does
Ideation: Scans Hacker News, Reddit, and Dev.to for trending dev topics

Content Generation: Uses LLMs to generate developer-focused blog posts

SEO Enhancement: Adds keyword richness, headers, meta descriptions

Style Validation: Enforces developer tone and clarity with markdown formatting

Publishing: Pushes the final blog to Notion via API

Analytics: Uses Firecrawl to evaluate published content performance

Refinement: Lays groundwork for feedback-based content improvement
